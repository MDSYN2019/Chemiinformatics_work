To use this package, you will need several additional programs.

You will obviously need Psi4 and OpenMM; see their respective websites
for installation help. Both packages have conda distributions.

In order to generate atom types, you will need Antechamber. The easiest
way to get a hold of this program is to get it through the ambermini
distribution on conda:  conda install -c omnia ambermini=16.16.0
Elsewise, you can compile your own version of AmberTools. See
http://ambermd.org/; the compilation is relatively straightforward.

For generating atom types, the program OpenBabel will also be needed. This
program can also be found on conda.

Currently, the python module pandas is needed for one method. This 
will likely be changed in the future. As of now, pandas is easily attained via conda.
