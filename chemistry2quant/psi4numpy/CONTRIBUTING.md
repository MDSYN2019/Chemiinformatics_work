Contributing to Psi4NumPy
=========================

Welcome to the Psi4NumPy Developer Community! 

The single largest factor which makes this repository an effective resource is
that it was inspired by, designed for, and maintained by the quantum &
computational chemistry community.  Therefore, your contributions to this
project are vital -- through reporting issues, contributing to discussions on
posts and pull requests, and/or submitting code of your own, you can impact how
this project moves forward and how well we serve yours as well as the needs of
the community. 

The following are a set of suggestions for the best way to contribute to the
Psi4NumPy project. Just like the Code of the Pirate Brethren set forth by Morgan and
Bartholomew, they're more what you'd call "guidelines" than actual rules.
Hopefully, however, this document (and the guidelines inside) will make
contributing to Psi4NumPy both easier and more effective for everyone.  

Good luck & happy coding!

# What do I need to know before starting to contribute to Psi4NumPy?

The strategic goals of the Psi4NumPy project are to provide the quantum chemistry community with
* a programming environment for rapid prototyping and method development,
* a repository for reference implementations of existing and novel quantum chemical methods, and
* an interactive educational framework which combines theory and implementation to effectively teach the
programming of quantum chemical methods.

For more information on these goals, refer to the [reference
implementation](#reference-implementations) and [interactive
tutorial](#interactive-tutorials) sections below, as well as the project
overview [here](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy#overview).  This repository contains

* reference implementations, which provide working Python scripts
implementing various quantum chemical methods, and
* interactive tutorials, which provide Jupyter notebooks presenting a hybrid 
theory-and-implementation educational framework for learning to program quantum 
chemistry methods.  

Reference implementations are organized into top-level directories
corresponding to the over-arching theory upon which each method is based, i.e.,
both EOM-CCSD and TD-CCSD are contained in the
[Coupled-Cluster](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/tree/master/Coupled-Cluster)
directory.  All interactive tutorials are contained in the top-level directory
[Tutorials](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/tree/master/Tutorials).  These
tutorials are organized in logical order of progression, which is enumerated in
detail
[here](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/tree/master/Tutorials#interactive-tutorials).

# How can I contribute to Psi4NumPy?

There are several ways to become involved with Psi4NumPy, including 

* participating in discussions on [pull
requests](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/pulls) and
[issues](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/issues),
* updating/adding features to existing content, and
* submitting new content to the repository.

Each of these possible contributions are highly valuable, and will help Psi4NumPy to
better serve the needs of the quantum/computational chemistry community at
large. Therefore, your contribution is crucial to the success of this project!

Below, guidelines for submitting new content are discussed, first for
[reference implementations](#reference-implementations) and then for
[interactive tutorials(#interactive-tutorials). For convenience, a possible
development workflow is given [here](#suggested-workflow).

## Reference Implementations

Reference implementations of quantum chemical methods should take the form of a
self-contained Python script which presents a complete program that
successfully implements the target method. Each such script should contain 

* an appropriate [header](#header-styleguide), 
* code with appropriate [Python style convention](#python-styleguide), 
* [references](#citation-styleguide) to relevant resources (algorithms, publications, etc.), and 
* [value comparison](#value-comparison) to ensure proper code function.  

In some cases, particularly with SAPT, CC, and CI theories, a fully
self-contained script may be long and complex enough that a self-contained
script may be too extensive to retain maximum readability, or multiple scripts
within the same method directory might benefit from some central machinery.  To
address both of these points:

1. for post-Hartree--Fock methods, call Psi4 for the HF energy & wavefunction with
```
scf_e, scf_wfn = psi4.energy('scf', return_wfn=True)
```
before implementing the target method, or 
2. creating a (or adding to an existing) method helper module which contains
helper classes and functions that refactors some of the method's
implementation.

If attempting to refactor the implementation to make use of a helper
module/class, it is critical to ensure that the reference implementation itself
is still explicit -- after all, one of the goals of Psi4NumPy is to provide
clear, readable implementations, even at the expense of program speed.

## Interactive Tutorials

Interactive tutorials provide a hybrid theory-and-implementation educational
framework within a Jupyter notebook for the reader to learn general information
about a method's formulation and detailed information with respect to the
method's implementation.  A good tutorial is not just about clear, correct code
(like the reference implementations) but also requires that each detail be
motivated logically and explained fully. Each tutorial contains 

* an appropriate [header](#header-styleguide), 
* a [theory overview](#theory-overview), 
* an [implementation](#implementation), 
* a testable [value comparison](#value-comparison), and 
* a list of relevant [citations](#citation-styleguide).  

#### Theory Overview

As the purpose of these tutorials is not to completely derive a method, it is
better to provide a broad-strokes overview of the formulation of the method, as
well as explicitly providing (or referencing) all equations to be implemented.
Fortunately, markdown cells within Jupyter notebooks support LaTeX math formatting,
and GitHub is capable of rendering these equations when viewing the notebook.  This
allows for provided equations to be typeset correctly and labeled accordingly,
using both `equation` and `align` environments.  For example, the time-independent
Schr√∂dinger equation as given in [Szabo:1996](https://books.google.com/books?id=KQ3DAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=szabo+%26+ostlund&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiYhv6A8YjUAhXLSCYKHdH5AJ4Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=szabo%20%26%20ostlund&f=false) can be typeset & labeled with
```
\begin{equation}
\widehat{H}\vert\Phi\rangle = E\vert\Phi\rangle \tag{[Szabo:1996], pp. 31, Eqn. 1.141}
\end{equation}
```

#### Implementation

This section should describe the details of the implementation, with particular
focus on *why* a certain algorithm or coding decision is made, not just what
the decision is.  For example, the naive O(N^8) integral transformation within
MP2 is discussed in the conventional MP2 tutorial
[here](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/blob/master/Tutorials/05_Moller-Plesset/5a_conventional-mp2.ipynb)
before the factored O(N^5) transformation is introduced.  This section benefits
from alternating markdown and code cells, so that the reader can execute the
cells alongside reading about the implementation.  Again, specific equations
within publications should be referenced with [LNFA:yy:pp] keys, which should
match those references within the `Tutorial References` section (see
[below](#citation-styleguide)).

**Note:** Every tutorial should be accompanied by a corresponding reference
implementation.  This is because the interactive tutorials are like a
classroom, while the reference implementation is like a textbook.  While a more
adventurous student may skip class to rely on reading the book, every class
needs an accompanying textbook for supporting material.  The accompanying
reference implementation can be as simple as reproducing the code cells in a
single script, or potentially more complex if supplemented by helper
functions/classes/modules.

**Note:** Before committing changes on a Jupyter notebook, please restart the
Python kernel so that minimal notebook metadata is stored.  This will help to
prevent spurious merge conflicts generated by different notebook extensions and
execution counts.

### Value Comparison

To ensure the continued health of contributed reference implementations and
interactive tutorials as Psi4 and NumPy development continues, provide one or
more `psi4.compare_values()` statements (documented
[here](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1/api/psi4.driver.compare_values.html?highlight=compare_values#psi4.driver.compare_values))
toward the end of your scripts/tutorials. These can contain a hard-coded
reference value or (if available) an equivalent pure-Psi4 computation:

```python
psi4.compare_values(expected, computed, digits, label)
```

where `expected` is the reference value, and `computed` is the final output of the
script/tutorial.  

Also for the health of the repository and to ensure continued
compatibility with Psi4 and NumPy advances, all reference
implementations and interactive tutorials should be added to the
testing framework. See tests/test_RI_*py and tests/test_TU_*py for
very simple models to follow. If running requires any special tools
(a latest version of Psi4 or NumPy, scipy, etc.), mark with decorators
from tests/addons.py. If running takes longer than ~40s on Travis,
additionally add `@pytest.mark.long` decorator to suppress CI testing.

## Styleguides

### Python Styleguide

All Python code should should conform to the
[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Python style guide
conventions.  This code should be compliant with Python versions 2.7/3.5/3.6,
meaning that `print` must be called as a function, i.e., `print('Compliant with
Python 3')` and not `print 'This will break Python 3!'`.

### Citation Styleguide

> TL;DR: Citations, including equation numbers, should be provided in close
> proximity (docstrings or comments) to the code. It can also be handy to collect
> all citations into the nearest README.md (for reference implementations) or
> final cell (for tutorials).

For both reference implementations and interactive tutorials, a complete list
of citations from which the content was drawn must be provided.  Such citation
lists should contain entries of the form (in Markdown):
```
1. [LNFA:yy:pp](https://link-to-publication-website.com) J. Doe *et al.* *J. Abbrev.* **Issue**, pages (year)
```
The LNFA:yy:pp citation key contains the last name of the first author (LNFA),
the publication year (yy), and the publication pages (pp), and the full
citation should be supplied in [AIP
format](https://publishing.aip.org/authors/preparing-your-manuscript) (see link
section Refernces -- By Number).  

For reference implementations, citations should appear 

* as full list items in the "References" section of the relevant method
directory's `README.md` file (see [Repository
Organization](#repository-organization) above), and 
* as keys followed by relevant equation information in code comments/function docstrings.  

This final point is important when specific equations from a publication are
implemented within the script.  In this case, a Python comment containing this
publication's citation key and the equation number for the expression
beingimplemented should be given nearby.  For example, to implement a function
which builds the `Wmnij` intermediate from equation 6 of [J. F.  Stanton *et
al.*'s paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.460620), 
```python
def build_Wmnij():
    """Implements [Stanton:1991:4334] Eqn. 6"""
    code code code
```

For interactive tutorials, unlike for reference implementations, a references
section within each tutorial should be included in a markdown cell at the very
end of the notebook.  This cell should contain a citation list of the form
above.  Since the tutorials are effectively standalone entities, however, this
`Tutorial References` section should *not* be augmented with a central
references section within the method's README.  Additionally, specific
equations should be referenced within tutorials using the citation key for the
appropriate publication.

### Header Styleguide

Each reference implementation script and tutorial notebook should begin with a
statement about the purpose of the script, author and contributor information,
and copyright, license, and date information (in [YYYY-MM-DD format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)):

```python
"""
A simple explanation of script contents.

References:
Algorithms taken from: https://some-source-url.com
Equations taken from: [LNFA:yy:pp] and [LNFA:yy:pp]
"""

__authors__   =  "John and Jane Doe"
__credits__   =  ["John Doe", "Jane Doe", "John Q. Sample"]

__copyright__ = "(c) 2014-2018, The Psi4NumPy Developers"
__license__   = "BSD-3-Clause"
__date__      = "2017-05-23"
```

The difference between `__authors__` and `__credits__` is largely semantic;
one possible delineation can be summarized by

* `__author__`: individuals who have written/modified large parts of the script/code
* `__credits__` : individuals who cleaned up or modified the code slightly.

In this way, all contributions are recognized and retained, no matter the scope.

### Documentation Styleguide

Documentation for the contents of the Psi4NumPy repository is contained in
`README.md` files in each directory.  

For reference implementations, `README.md` files in the `method-dir` should contain
* a *very* brief overview of the most important aspects of the theory,
* a description of the primary arrays, variables, and indices for the method,
* a description of the proper use and capabilities of any helper classes or modules, and
* a list containing relevant citations for all scripts in the `method-dir` (see [above](#citation-styleguide))
See the SAPT README [here](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/blob/master/Symmetry-Adapted-Perturbation-Theory/README.md)
for an example.

For interactive tutorials, two levels of `README.md` files exist.  First, the
`README` for the main `Tutorials` folder
[here](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/tree/master/Tutorials) contains a list
of available tutorials grouped by module.  Second, in each
`module-dir/README.md`, a more detailed list of the module and individual
tutorial contents is given.  See the Hartree--Fock module README
[here](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/blob/master/Tutorials/03_Hartree-Fock/README.md)
for an example.

## Development Workflow

The Psi4NumPy repository has adopted the forking workflow within Github: the
[what](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#forking-workflow)
and
[how](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1/build_obtaining.html#what-is-the-suggested-github-workflow)
(replace `psi4.git` with `psi4numpy.git`) of this process has been discussed elsewhere.  Additionally, the [GitHub
guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) provides a graphical
representation which visualizes this process.
