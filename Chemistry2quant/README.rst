This is a short project working on using Machine Learning Algorithms to predict potential drug molecules from the chembl database.

This module/tutorial primarily utilized Python 3.0+, and the modules rdkit and tensorflow, as shown in these links:

https://www.rdkit.org/

https://www.tensorflow.org/

In the future, I intend to add a pipeline of workflow to directly simulate these chemiinformatics code to QM calculations using
psi4:
