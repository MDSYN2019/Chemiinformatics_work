  The algorithm is described in Finn et al., "Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast
  Adaptation of Deep Networks" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400).  It is used for
  training models that can perform a variety of tasks, depending on what data they
  are trained on.  It assumes you have training data for many tasks, but only a small
  amount for each one.  It performs "meta-learning" by looping over tasks and trying
  to minimize the loss on each one *after* one or a few steps of gradient descent.
  That is, it does not try to create a model that can directly solve the tasks, but
  rather tries to create a model that is very easy to train.

  To use this class, create a subclass of MetaLearner that encapsulates the model
  and data for your learning problem.  Pass it to a MAML object and call fit().
  You can then use train_on_current_task() to fine tune the model for a particular
  task.
