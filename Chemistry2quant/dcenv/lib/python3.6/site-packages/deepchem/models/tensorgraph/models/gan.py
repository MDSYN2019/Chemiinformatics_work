class GAN(TensorGraph):
  """Implements Generative Adversarial Networks.

  A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a type of generative model.  It
  consists of two parts called the "generator" and the "discriminator".  The
  generator takes random noise as input and transforms it into an output that
  (hopefully) resembles the training data.  The discriminator takes a set of
  samples as input and tries to distinguish the real training samples from the
  ones created by the generator.  Both of them are trained together.  The
  discriminator tries to get better and better at telling real from false data,
  while the generator tries to get better and better at fooling the discriminator.

  In many cases there also are additional inputs to the generator and
  discriminator.  In that case it is known as a Conditional GAN (CGAN), since it
  learns a distribution that is conditional on the values of those inputs.  They
  are referred to as "conditional inputs".

  Many variations on this idea have been proposed, and new varieties of GANs are
  constantly being proposed.  This class tries to make it very easy to implement
  straightforward GANs of the most conventional types.  At the same time, it
  tries to be flexible enough that it can be used to implement many (but
  certainly not all) variations on the concept.

  To define a GAN, you must create a subclass that provides implementations of
  the following methods:

  get_noise_input_shape()
  get_data_input_shapes()
  create_generator()
  create_discriminator()

  If you want your GAN to have any conditional inputs you must also implement:

  get_conditional_input_shapes()

  The following methods have default implementations that are suitable for most
  conventional GANs.  You can override them if you want to customize their
  behavior:

  create_generator_loss()
  create_discriminator_loss()
  get_noise_batch()

  This class allows a GAN to have multiple generators and discriminators, a model
  known as MIX+GAN.  It is described in Arora et al., "Generalization and
  Equilibrium in Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00573).
  This can lead to better models, and is especially useful for reducing mode
  collapse, since different generators can learn different parts of the
  distribution.  To use this technique, simply specify the number of generators
  and discriminators when calling the constructor.  You can then tell
  predict_gan_generator() which generator to use for predicting samples.

  """Implements Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks.

  This class implements Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) as
  described in Arjovsky et al., "Wasserstein GAN" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875).
  A WGAN is conceptually rather different from a conventional GAN, but in
  practical terms very similar.  It reinterprets the discriminator (often called
  the "critic" in this context) as learning an approximation to the Earth Mover
  distance between the training and generated distributions.  The generator is
  then trained to minimize that distance.  In practice, this just means using
  slightly different loss functions for training the generator and discriminator.

  WGANs have theoretical advantages over conventional GANs, and they often work
  better in practice.  In addition, the discriminator's loss function can be
  directly interpreted as a measure of the quality of the model.  That is an
  advantage over conventional GANs, where the loss does not directly convey
  information about the quality of the model.

  The theory WGANs are based on requires the discriminator's gradient to be
  bounded.  The original paper achieved this by clipping its weights.  This
  class instead does it by adding a penalty term to the discriminator's loss, as
  described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028.  This is sometimes found to
  produce better results.

  There are a few other practical differences between GANs and WGANs.  In a
  conventional GAN, the discriminator's output must be between 0 and 1 so it can
  be interpreted as a probability.  In a WGAN, it should produce an unbounded
  output that can be interpreted as a distance.

  When training a WGAN, you also should usually use a smaller value for
  generator_steps.  Conventional GANs rely on keeping the generator and
  discriminator "in balance" with each other.  If the discriminator ever gets
  too good, it becomes impossible for the generator to fool it and training
  stalls.  WGANs do not have this problem, and in fact the better the
  discriminator is, the easier it is for the generator to improve.  It therefore
  usually works best to perform several training steps on the discriminator for
  each training step on the generator.
