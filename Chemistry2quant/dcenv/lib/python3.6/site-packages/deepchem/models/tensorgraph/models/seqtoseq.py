  """Implements sequence to sequence translation models.

  The model is based on the description in Sutskever et al., "Sequence to
  Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215),
  although this implementation uses GRUs instead of LSTMs.  The goal is to
  take sequences of tokens as input, and translate each one into a different
  output sequence.  The input and output sequences can both be of variable
  length, and an output sequence need not have the same length as the input
  sequence it was generated from.  For example, these models were originally
  developed for use in natural language processing.  In that context, the
  input might be a sequence of English words, and the output might be a
  sequence of French words.  The goal would be to train the model to translate
  sentences from English to French.

  The model consists of two parts called the "encoder" and "decoder".  Each one
  consists of a stack of recurrent layers.  The job of the encoder is to
  transform the input sequence into a single, fixed length vector called the
  "embedding".  That vector contains all relevant information from the input
  sequence.  The decoder then transforms the embedding vector into the output
  sequence.

  These models can be used for various purposes.  First and most obviously,
  they can be used for sequence to sequence translation.  In any case where you
  have sequences of tokens, and you want to translate each one into a different
  sequence, a SeqToSeq model can be trained to perform the translation.

  Another possible use case is transforming variable length sequences into
  fixed length vectors.  Many types of models require their inputs to have a
  fixed shape, which makes it difficult to use them with variable sized inputs
  (for example, when the input is a molecule, and different molecules have
  different numbers of atoms).  In that case, you can train a SeqToSeq model as
  an autoencoder, so that it tries to make the output sequence identical to the
  input one.  That forces the embedding vector to contain all information from
  the original sequence.  You can then use the encoder for transforming
  sequences into fixed length embedding vectors, suitable to use as inputs to
  other types of models.

  Another use case is to train the decoder for use as a generative model.  Here
  again you begin by training the SeqToSeq model as an autoencoder.  Once
  training is complete, you can supply arbitrary embedding vectors, and
  transform each one into an output sequence.  When used in this way, you
  typically train it as a variational autoencoder.  This adds random noise to
  the encoder, and also adds a constraint term to the loss that forces the
  embedding vector to have a unit Gaussian distribution.  You can then pick
  random vectors from a Gaussian distribution, and the output sequences should
  follow the same distribution as the training data.

  When training as a variational autoencoder, it is best to use KL cost
  annealing, as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06349.  The constraint
  term in the loss is initially set to 0, so the optimizer just tries to
  minimize the reconstruction loss.  Once it has made reasonable progress
  toward that, the constraint term can be gradually turned back on.  The range
  of steps over which this happens is configurable.

  This is an implementation of Automatic Chemical Design Using a Continuous Representation of Molecules
  http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00572

  Abstract
  --------
  We report a method to convert discrete representations of molecules to and
  from a multidimensional continuous representation. This model allows us to
  generate new molecules for efficient exploration and optimization through
  open-ended spaces of chemical compounds. A deep neural network was trained on
  hundreds of thousands of existing chemical structures to construct three
  coupled functions: an encoder, a decoder, and a predictor. The encoder
  converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued
  continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous vectors back to
  discrete molecular representations. The predictor estimates chemical
  properties from the latent continuous vector representation of the molecule.
  Continuous representations of molecules allow us to automatically generate
  novel chemical structures by performing simple operations in the latent space,
  such as decoding random vectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or
  interpolating between molecules. Continuous representations also allow the use
  of powerful gradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for
  optimized functional compounds. We demonstrate our method in the domain of
  drug-like molecules and also in a set of molecules with fewer that nine heavy
  atoms.

  Notes
  -------
  This is currently an imperfect reproduction of the paper.  One difference is
  that teacher forcing in the decoder is not implemented.  The paper also
  discusses co-learning molecular properties at the same time as training the
  encoder/decoder.  This is not done here.  The hyperparameters chosen are from
  ZINC dataset.

  This network also currently suffers from exploding gradients.  Care has to be taken when training.

  NOTE(LESWING): Will need to play around with annealing schedule to not have exploding gradients
  TODO(LESWING): Teacher Forcing
  TODO(LESWING): Sigmoid variational loss annealing schedule
  The output GRU layer had one
  additional input, corresponding to the character sampled from the softmax output of the
  previous time step and was trained using teacher forcing. 48 This increased the accuracy
  of generated SMILES strings, which resulted in higher fractions of valid SMILES strings
  for latent points outside the training data, but also made training more difficult, since the
  decoder showed a tendency to ignore the (variational) encoding and rely solely on the input
  sequence. The variational loss was annealed according to sigmoid schedule after 29 epochs,
  running for a total 120 epochs

  I also added a BatchNorm before the mean and std embedding layers.  This has empiracally
  made training more stable, and is discussed in Ladder Variational Autoencoders.
  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02282.pdf
  Maybe if Teacher Forcing and Sigmoid variational loss annealing schedule are used the
  BatchNorm will no longer be neccessary.
