"""
Testing a package

How to distribute your projects locally within a small team or globally through PyPI.

All the top-level files, CHANGELOG.rst, LICENSE, README.rst, MANIFEST.in and 
setup.py are discussed in more detail.

Functional and unit tests are separated into their own directories. This is an arbitrary decision and not required. 
However, organizing test files into multiple directories allows you to easily run a subset of tests.
