Density Functional Theory
=========================

This module seeks to provide an overview of the theory and programming challenges associated with Density Functional Theory with the following tutorials:

- 4a DFT Grid: Briefly outlines several details of the DFT Grid.

- 4b LDA Kernel: Discusses how the local density approximation (LDA) is formed and computed.

- 4c GGA and Meta Kernels: Focuses on higher derivates of DFT and examines how to compute various functionals.

- 4d VV10: A guide to compute the non-local kernel VV10

- 4e GRAC: Demonstrates the failures of DFT for ionization potentials and illustrates the gradient regularized asymptotic correction (GRAC).
