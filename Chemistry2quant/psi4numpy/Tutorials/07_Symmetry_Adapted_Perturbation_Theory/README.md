Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory 
==================================

At present, this module contains two tutorials on the background and implementation of closed-shell symmetry-adapted perturbation theory:

- (7a) Conventional SAPT0: Introduces the standard, molecular orbital formalism of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory at the SAPT0 level and computes the SAPT0 corrections for the water dimer.

- (7b) AO-based SAPT0: Evaluates the same SAPT0 corrections for the water dimer via a (mostly) atomic orbital-based algorithm.
