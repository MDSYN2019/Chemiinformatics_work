    "The key insight is that a discrete Fourier transform can be performed using a fast recursion algorithm if the atoms are arranged on a uniform mesh, hence the name particle mesh Ewald (PME).  A method that only works for selected configurations would be useless, so PME uses spline interpolation to effectively coerce the atoms to predefined, regularly spaced locations.  Consider some function $f$ we've tabulated at every integer.  If we want either $f(12)$ or $f(13)$, we're in luck and can just look up the tabulated values.  However, $f(12.5)$ would come from $\\frac{f(12)+f(13)}{2}$, while $f(12.1)$ would be best approximated with two points by $0.9f(12) + 0.1f(13)$. This simple order 2 example can be generalized to order $n$, with the coefficients of each pre-tabulated data point provided by an order $n$ *spline* function.

    "The PME energy performs similarly to regular Ewald summation, with significantly better asymptotic scaling.  Forces may be evaluated easily by replacing the splines used to probe the potential grid with their derivatives, which are defined by a very simple recursion relation, as outlined by Darden and co-workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In developing the absolutely convergent sums above, we seem to have magically removed the conditional convergence.  The reason for this is somewhat complicated and beyond the scope of this discussion.  The conditional convergence results from the mutual interaction of the image cells' dipole moments.  By thinking of the periodic system not as an infinite system, but a large macroscopic crystal with a given shape (we considered cubes and spheres in the lattice sum code above) is is possible to derive a \"correction\" to the Ewald energy that describes the conditionally (and therefore crystal shape) dependent part of the lattice sum.  Such corrections have been derived for various crystal shapes, and they all depend on the cell dipole.  In dynamic simulations under periodic boundary condisions, a charge particle exiting the top of a unit cell will reappear at the bottom, possibly flipping the dipole of the cell.  If the extra shape-dependent term were considered in this circumstance, the potential energy would be discontinuous, so these corrections are usually neglected.\n",
